class Tablet:
    """
    The Tablet class is part of the Drawing domain which provides a service to an application
    with simple 2D diagramming needs such as the Flatland model diagram generator.

    Most importantly, the Drawing domain and hence the Tablet abstract away the details of
    graphics library interaction from the fundamental diagramming application.

    The original implementation of Tablet supported the Cairo graphics library while the current
    implementation is built on the Qt Gui framework. No changes are necessary in any client diagramming
    applications that draw on a Tablet.

    For example, when a Flatland node compartment wants to draw itself, it doesn't worry about line
    widths, dash patterns and colors. It also doesn't worry about flipping to whatever coordinate
    system the graphics library uses. A compartment would just say "add_shape( asset, size, location )" and
    the Tablet will take care of the rest. Here the asset is the name of the model entity 'compartment',
    the size in points (or whatever units the Flatland app wants to use) and location expressed in Flatland
    Canvas coordinates.

    When a Tablet is created, it is initialized with a single populated Layer where Assets can be drawn.
    For example, Flatland might start with a predefined 'diagram' Layer using a Drawing Type such as
    'state machine diagram' and a Presentation such as 'default' or 'formal' or 'corporate'.

    The Diagram Type determines what kinds of things might be drawn, Assets such as 'connector',
    'compartment', 'class name', etc., while the Presentation establishes the Text and Line Styles to
    be used when drawing those Assets. All of this information is stored in yaml files which the Tablet
    loads upon creation.

    Each time the application wants something drawn, it will ask Tablet to add the appropriate Asset
    to one of its render lists. A separate list is maintained for all the rectangles, line segments and
    text lines to be rendered. When the application is finished populating these lists, the Tablet can
    render everything using its graphic library (Qt in this implementation) using whatever coordinate
    system the library supplies, making any necessary conversions from the application coordinate system.

        Attributes and relationships defined on the class model

        - ID {I} -- Unique id, implemented as a reference to a Tablet object, no attribute needed
        - Size -- The height and width of the drawing surface (attribute)
        - Output_file -- A filename or output stream object to be output as a drawing (attribute)
        - Background_color -- The color of the Tablet (visible through all non-opaque layer elements)
