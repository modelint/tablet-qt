# symbols.yaml – User defined symbols

# A symbol is a bounding box containing any combination of shape elements
# such as circles, paths, and triangles. For example, you can define an xUML
# final psuedo-state symbols consisting of a path for the stem consisting of two
# colinear points, a path for the arrow head consisting of three points, one at the
# arrow head and the other two above it, and then a large and smaller circle sharing
# the same center with the arrow pointing into it. The bigger circle has a white fill
# with the smaller having a black fill.

# A common use case for symbols, in fact the motivating use case, is to support
# decorations at the end of connectors in the flatland application. So when we want
# to decorate the end of a transition in a state machine with an arrow head, the client
# application can provide a location and an angle so that the arrow head nicely lines up
# with the end of the transition connector path. The same principle works for any decorations
# on associations, generalizations, and any other kind of connector path.

# To define a symbol, we specify the coordinates of each shape element within a symbol
# bounding box. # The box should shrink wrap all the content with the origin at the
# bottom center of the bounding box. When the client app requests a symbol at some
# tablet location, the origin will be positioned there and rotated to a requested angle.
#  You can imagine a thumbtack at the origin that gets pushed into the
# requested location with the symbol rotated as desired.

# So let's say you want to define a simple solid arrow head with a filled in triangle.

# pointing upward. The size of the bounding box is the width of the arrow base and the height
# up to the arrow point. The center of the base will be at 0,0 with the nose at say 0,5 for
# a five point length arrow head. Now if the app askes to place that arrow head at say
# 300,300 in tablet coordinates, rotated at 90 degrees, the arrow will point to the right
# with its base center at 300,300 where, presumably, the app will end its connector path to
# meet the base center. Keep in mind that all of this is in tablet coordinates where the
# lower left corner of the tablet is 0,0. We always specify in tablet coordinates and let
# Tablet do any device coordinate conversions for us depending on whatever graphics library it
# is built on.
