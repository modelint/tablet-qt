# stickers.yaml â€“ User defined stickers

# A Sticker is a predefiend string of text that can be 'stuck' somewhere on a Layer
# associated with a Text Asset

# See the Text Asset and Sticker classes in the Presentation Subsystem class model for more details

# UML diagrams rely heavily on predefined text with a few added xUML tags
xUML class diagram:  # Drawing Type name
  class face name: # Text Asset name
    1 mult: '1'  # Sticker name : text
    1c mult: '0..1'
    M mult: '1..*'
    Mc mult: '0..*'
  association name:
    M mult: '{M}'
  superclass face name:
    superclass: '{disjoint, complete}'

# Note that Starr class diagrams don't use any Stickers at all (to highlight the subject matter, not the notation)

# The Shlaer-Mellor class diagram notation specifies just one
