    A common feature of many drawing and image editing applications is the ability to stack layers of
    content along a z axis toward the userâ€™s viewpoint. Similarly, the Tablet renders each layer working
    from the lowest value on the z axis toward the highest. Thus, content on the higher layers may overlap
    content underneath.
